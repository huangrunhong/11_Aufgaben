            <h4>Shattering cookware</h4>
            <p>
              More than 37,000 people were injured from using cookware. Hot
              handles can burn and sometimes glass cookware can shatter.

            <h4>Microwave oven burns</h4>
            <p>
              More than 10,000 people were hurt using microwaves. Burns were
              most common.

            <h4>Knife cuts</h4>
            <p>
              Lacerations caused by knives of all kinds (not just the kitchen
              type) affected more than 350,000 people in 2012, according to the
              Consumer Product Safety Commission. Dull knives are actually more
              dangerous than sharp ones, because they require more pressure to
              use and their worn edge can cause the knife to slip off food and
              into your fingers.

            <h4>Cooking fires</h4>
            <p>
              Fires involving cooking equipment account for two of every five
              reported home fires. Unattended cooking equipment accounts for one
              in three fires, and half are ignited by fat, grease, oil, or
              related substances, according to the National Fire Protection
              Association.

            <h4>Contact Burns From Equipment</h4>
            <p>
              The oven is magic. No longer do we have to sear our food on an
              open fire like our ancestors did; we have a nifty box that keeps
              the heat contained and cooks our food to perfection. But all that
              heat combined with metal components and cookware leads to loads of
              burns. Quick tips (which are obvious, but good to keep in mind):
              Always use oven mitts, replace them when they’re old; don’t use a
              wet towel as an oven mitt; don’t reach your arm in to check baked
              goods, pull out the rack to test;
            </p>

            <h4>Death to the Pathogens</h4>
            <p>
              The most insidious of all dangers, perhaps, are the germs lurking
              in your food. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
              estimates that each year roughly one in six Americans (or 48
              million people) gets sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die
              of foodborne diseases. The top five culprits sending Americans to
              the hospital are salmonella, norovirus, Campylobacter spp.,
              Toxoplasma gondii and E.coli – but much can be done in terms of
              proper food handling, cooking and storage to help prevent these
              pathogens from causing illness.
